### Thoughts about custom/own/another/best ever frameworks

The good illustration of framework's live circle list:

 * [MontageJS](https://github.com/montagejs/montage)
 
   Looks like cool implementation of all the things modern development has, but it's very outdated, dom manipulation instead of

   it is about all the code of the framework.
